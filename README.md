# Core Java Principles

The following "Main.java" program is a compilation of many of the key basics of Java and serves as the first "tutorial" Java project I've made. The vast majority of the information contained in the lessons comes
from the "Bro Code" YouTube channel (thank you, Bro Code).

As a student who has already learned and practiced the fundamentals of the language, I've created this program in hopes of teaching any acquaintances, friends, or family in the future.

If you have IntelliJ IDEA, or any IDE that runs Java, the easiest way to use this project is to open it in your respective IDE, uncomment one (only one) specific lesson, and run the "Main.java" program to view the output of that lesson.
